&lt;h1 id=&#34;reading:the12weekyear&#34;&gt;Reading: The 12 Week Year&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/12-Week-Year-Others-Months/dp/1118509234&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft&#34; title=&#34;Book Cover&#34; src=&#34;https://i2.wp.com/ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51hvFjxxw3L._SY344_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg?resize=224%2C346&#34; data-recalc-dims=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/12-Week-Year-Others-Months/dp/1118509234&#34;&gt;12 Week Year&lt;/a&gt;_ was an interesting book for me to read because the authors used to be clients when I worked as part of &lt;a href=&#34;http://brilliantfantastic.com&#34;&gt;BrilliantFantastic&lt;/a&gt;. Having now read the book, I feel like I would have been able to do so much more for Brian and Mike (and our other clients) had I read the book then. &lt;em&gt;The 12 Week Year&lt;/em&gt; is all about execution. Execution isn’t necessarily fun to think about, but it keeps you honest about what you are actually accomplishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;isthisrecommendedreading&#34;&gt;Is this Recommended Reading?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have goals then yes, and it’s a pretty small, quick read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have pretty high hopes and dreams. I also have a lot of ambitions and plans that have fallen flat on their faces because I didn’t execute on the things I should have. &lt;em&gt;The 12 Week Year&lt;/em&gt; gives you a pretty simple framework for determining what to work on and tracking the work you’ve done so that you can determine if you had a bad idea or if you simply aren’t doing anything. Prepare for a humbling experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;thegistofit&#34;&gt;The Gist of It&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its core I think there are two main concepts in _The 12 Week Year_:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deadlines are good, and thinking outside of the 12-month calendar lets you have more of those. Specifically, thinking in 12-week sections (ie a &amp;#8220;12 week year&amp;#8221;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideas are great, but if you really want to achieve things you need to go out and take the steps that matter. You must also own those actions, both successful or failures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brian and Mike go on to explain how the mind&amp;#8217;s perception of time/immediacy changes how we work, and how our emotions change when we’re working on something that gets us out of our comfort zone. Knowing how your mind works gives you the power to change it&amp;#8217;s course or expect the next emotion/feeling based on what&amp;#8217;s just happened, and that&amp;#8217;s powerful for&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the content of the book feels like common sense after you read it, but it’s not the way we tend to think on a day to day basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are quite a few good nuggets in here about prioritizing your work based on how the tasks line up with your goals and cutting out the extras if they aren’t helping you make real progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;mytakeaways&#34;&gt;My Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had quite a few big takeaways from this book that I’ve been putting into practice every day since I read it. I love the idea of tracking my execution on a day to day, week to week basis. Keeping the stats on how well I’m doing the things that I believe will get me to my goal shows me if I’m not putting in the effort necessary and is also helping me bring myself back into focus if I find myself distracted and working on something tangential to my goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides just tracking stats, Brian and Mike have laid out a great framework for creating S.M.A.R.T goals that make it easy to dig down into what your current focus should be. I’ve had a hard time in the past whittling my goals down into something that gets me out of my comfort zone, yet it actually measurable and possible, but &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/12-Week-Year-Others-Months/dp/1118509234&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 12 Week Year&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is helping me to structure my goals in a way that makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reading: How to Win Friends &amp; Influence People</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft wp-image-65 size-medium&#34; src=&#34;https://i0.wp.com/keiththomps.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/how-to-win-friends-193x300.jpg?fit=193%2C300&#34; alt=&#34;How to Win Friends &amp; Influence People&#34; srcset=&#34;https://i1.wp.com/keiththomps.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/how-to-win-friends.jpg?resize=193%2C300 193w, https://i1.wp.com/keiththomps.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/how-to-win-friends.jpg?w=660 660w, https://i1.wp.com/keiththomps.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/how-to-win-friends.jpg?resize=644%2C999 644w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 193px) 100vw, 193px&#34; data-recalc-dims=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Win Friends &amp;amp; Influence People&lt;/em&gt; might just be my favorite book, because it’s a book that I need to keep reading. I enjoy taking the initiative and leading my endeavors, ranging from school projects to mentoring to work projects. The issue that I’ve continually run into in situations where I would lead is that the people around me wouldn’t enjoy it, and nobody wants to be the guy leading the miserable project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;is-this-recommended-reading&#34;&gt;Is this Recommended Reading?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. Yes. Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve often heard it said in software that no project has ever failed for technical reasons, they all fail because of people. The most important thing that we can learn to do is interact with those around us and build one another up. &lt;em&gt;How to Win Friends &amp;amp; Influence People&lt;/em&gt; is a book that describes just that in a practical way. This book is full of principles, strategies, and tactics for interacting with people in such a way that it’s beneficial for everyone. The worst part about this book is that its title sounds a bit like it’s about manipulating people, but in truth, this book is more about not being a jerk than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-gist-of-it&#34;&gt;The Gist of It&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Win Friends &amp;amp; Influence People&lt;/em&gt; is broken into four separate sections:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fundamental Techniques in Handling People&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Six Ways to Make People Like You&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to Win People to Your Way of Thinking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be a Leader: How to Change People without Giving Offense or Arousing Resentment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All four of the sections are good, but they actually cover the same information and techniques by applying them in different contexts. The overarching premise behind the book is that people want what they want, and each and every one of us is more interested in our thoughts, desires, and selves than we are in others. The ticket to winning friends and influencing people is to acknowledge this fact and listen to people. There are other nuggets of information in here that are exceptionally useful related to how people react to the exact ways that you say things to them also, but those ideas aren’t even useful until we start to internalize that people care about their desires and selves more than all else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-takeaways&#34;&gt;My Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Win Friends &amp;amp; Influence People&lt;/em&gt; is such an important book to me because it addresses one of my key flaws, I hurt people&amp;#8217;s feelings unintentionally… a lot. I do this by correcting people, almost every time that they are wrong. Dale Carnegie does a great job of pointing out you can’t get people to do or think the way you would like them to by telling them that they are wrong. In general, people will dig their heels into the ground when you point out their flaws and resist your ideas even if you &lt;em&gt;prove&lt;/em&gt; that you’re correct. This provides a wealth of insight when it comes to disagreeing with someone, and how to address a situation when you know you’re right. For me, I need to let people think their own thoughts, and I should only approach correcting someone if the subject is truly important. If I do decide that it would greatly benefit the other person I need to not tell them they’re wrong, but rather ask them questions to see if I can lead them to what I know to be true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other big thing that I’ve taken away from this book both times that I’ve read it is that I need to search out and appreciate the good qualities of other people. In general, I’m surrounded by awesome people, but our culture has trained all of us to complain about everything that we see that is “wrong”. That habit (which many of us share) has a negative impact on our lives because it blocks us from seeing all of the great things and people around us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The takeaways from &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/1439167346&#34;&gt;How to Win Friends &amp;amp; Influence People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; are so important in my eyes that this is a book that I will continually come back to and reread for years to come and I encourage everyone to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Recovering from Poor Planning</title>
      <link>http://keiththomps.com/2016/02/08/recovering-from-poor-planning/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;My goal of reading one book a week didn&amp;#8217;t make it that far without a few hiccups. Reading &lt;em&gt;Good to Great&lt;/em&gt; took me a day longer than I was expecting and the book I had scheduled to follow that was a pretty big technical book. I was unable to finish reading all of &lt;em&gt;Programming Elixir&lt;/em&gt; within the week that I allotted for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;poor-planning-of-a-good-goal&#34;&gt;Poor Planning of a Good Goal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally, this would be the point where people would throw in the towel on a New Year&amp;#8217;s resolution because they&amp;#8217;ve already &amp;#8220;failed&amp;#8221;, but it shows me that I did a poor job of planning a reasonable goal. I&amp;#8217;m not the fastest reader by nature (I subvocalize, and I tend to get distracted and need to re-read passages), so 1 book a week would be fine if I only planned on reading books that we  small. That&amp;#8217;s not what I&amp;#8217;m actually going for, I want to read 52 books in a year. Some books will take me longer than others, and I shouldn&amp;#8217;t be concerned by that unless I get to the point where I can&amp;#8217;t possibly read 52 books by December 31, 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s important to set &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; goals and the way that I worded my reading goal set me up for failure. If I chose to read something that got me out of my comfort zone there was a good chance it would take longer than a week, so I&amp;#8217;m adjusting the wording of my goal to be this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will read 52 books in a year, &lt;em&gt;averaging&lt;/em&gt; 1 book per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Reading: Good to Great</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-41 alignleft&#34; src=&#34;https://i0.wp.com/keiththomps.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Good-to-Great-197x300.jpg?fit=197%2C300&#34; alt=&#34;Good to Great&#34; srcset=&#34;https://i2.wp.com/keiththomps.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Good-to-Great.jpg?resize=197%2C300 197w, https://i2.wp.com/keiththomps.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Good-to-Great.jpg?w=525 525w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 197px) 100vw, 197px&#34; data-recalc-dims=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;Good to Great&lt;/em&gt; is one of the business books that I’ve heard many people talk about and since Kendra had to read some of it in college, we happened to have a copy lying around. I haven&amp;#8217;t read many business books, but I really enjoy talking to entrepreneurs and business people because their world is so different from my own. This puts me in the place of the constant student; there’s always something that I can learn from those in business. I am incredibly glad I decided to read it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;is-this-recommended-reading&#34;&gt;Is this Recommended Reading?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Good to Great&lt;/em&gt; is truly a great book. I don’t think the “American Dream” is having a house with a white picket fence anymore, I think the dream is to be part of something awesome. This book does a great job of going through companies that fit into this category (even if I don’t particularly like what they’re selling). This book presents the findings of a multi-year study that have pretty interesting ramifications on the way people do and should think about business. Beyond the business side, though, I find &lt;em&gt;Good to Great&lt;/em&gt; to be surprisingly beneficial for an individual, non-entrepreneur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-gist-of-it&#34;&gt;The Gist of It&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James Collins wrote a book before this one called &lt;em&gt;Built to Last&lt;/em&gt;, that showed how some new companies laid the groundwork for having enduring greatness from the very beginning of their inception. &lt;em&gt;Good to Great&lt;/em&gt; was written for the rest of us. What if our hypothetical companies didn’t start out great? Can we get there? The research follows companies that were mediocre or absolutely failing, yet turned it around and became something truly special. They&amp;#8217;ve distilled down the things that they all had in common. Here are the things they had in common:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Level 5 Leaders. People who put the success of the company above their own ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Focus on the right people before the right business direction&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) Unwavering faith in their ability to succeed even if the current reality is negative, never ignoring the hard facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) A unified vision that they adhere to (the “Hedgehog Concept”) in all of their actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) A company culture of discipline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) Utilizing technology to accelerate momentum. Note: It can’t be used to create the movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had to summarize the entire book into one sentence it would be this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Surround yourself with the right people, find your singular focus, and foster the passion for that focus to attain greatness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-takeaways&#34;&gt;My Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book is almost entirely about having the right people around you, from the executives in a company to the lowliest of laborers in the company. Having people who share the same core values and vision allows you to become great, so long as you don’t deviate from your “Hedgehog Concept”. I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking about the people I surround myself with for a few months now, so that wasn&amp;#8217;t as profound for me as it could have been a short while ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “Hedgehog Concept” is probably the most profound thing that I was able to take away from this book. I’ve become more and more focused on achieving goals recently, but I’m still finding it hard to decide what my goals should be. I really think the “Hedgehog Concept” is going to help that. The idea is that you find something that meets all of these criteria:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) You can be the best in the world at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) It works towards your statistic for success (“economic denominator”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) You are passionate about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you’ve found the intersection of those three criteria &amp;#8211; your Hedgehog Concept &amp;#8211; you can base all of your decisions around whether or not they contribute to you making progress towards that goal. Our culture is one of everyone being incredibly busy, but getting so very little done. I think working to find this central focus to what we do could truly help people feel more fulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, I’m going to be making sure I’ve surrounded myself with the right people and striving to find my “Hedgehog Concept”. I’ll be using another thing I picked up from this book to keep my focus high, the “stop doing” list.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reading: The School of Greatness</title>
      <link>http://keiththomps.com/2016/01/23/the-school-of-greatness/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: justify;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-34 alignleft&#34; src=&#34;https://i2.wp.com/keiththomps.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/school_of_greatness-196x300.jpg?fit=196%2C300&#34; alt=&#34;school_of_greatness&#34; srcset=&#34;https://i2.wp.com/keiththomps.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/school_of_greatness.jpg?resize=196%2C300 196w, https://i2.wp.com/keiththomps.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/school_of_greatness.jpg?w=226 226w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 196px) 100vw, 196px&#34; data-recalc-dims=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;The School of Greatness&lt;/em&gt; is Lewis Howe’s study of numerous successful people who embody his definition of greatness. The investigation of the similarities and shared features of these people gives insight into some habits that are truly beneficial. I love this kind of book, being able to learn from the experiences of others is something that I can’t get enough of.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;is-this-recommended-reading&#34;&gt;Is this Recommended Reading?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being the first book of the week, I’m trying not to look at this book through rose colored glasses, but that being said I really enjoyed this book. I’m always looking to improve and I think this book gives some great actionable steps to move in that direction. I would definitely suggest people read this, especially young people who haven’t really gotten out in the world. Some of the ideas in this book could have helped me focus and move towards my own goals in college when I fell off the tracks a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-gist-of-it&#34;&gt;The Gist of It&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first few chapters of this book I instantly felt that this book was a combination of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/The-Habits-Highly-Effective-People/dp/0743269519&#34;&gt;The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Miracle-Morning-Not-So-Obvious-Guaranteed-Transform/dp/0979019710&#34;&gt;The Miracle Morning&lt;/a&gt;. I love both of these books and was pretty sure I was going to enjoy this book also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each chapter covers a habit or characteristic of greatness. Most of these are things that are often said in these types of books, but the thing that really sets this book apart are the exercises that are at the end of each chapter. There are multiple exercises and they’re really laid out in a step-by-step way for anybody to be able to sit down and go through them easily. Here are the subjects of the chapters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a Vision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn Adversity into Advantage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cultivate a Champions Mindset&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop Hustle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Master Your Body&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practice Positive Habits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a Winning Team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Live a Life of Service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-takeaways&#34;&gt;My Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the sections in this book were expected. Almost every book I’ve read on this topic has included something about vision, hustle, habits, and health, but some of the topics I had not expected to read about. The amount that this book talks about being grateful caught me off guard. The suggestion that one of the key factors for greatness is living a life of service was a concept that I was happy to here. Pointing out that great people don’t become great all by themselves was eye opening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently Kendra and I have started going through our “highs” and “lows” each night. We say at least three good things and we say at most one bad thing that happened during the day. This practice has been really enjoyable for me lately and really has left me quite a bit happier. I can definitely see how being grateful can help push a person in the direction of greatness. I was sick and exhausted all week, and yet I’ve felt happy and productive the entire time. I consider having a cold to be one of the worst things because it’s annoying and lingers, and because of that view it usually brings me down pretty badly. Knowing that at the end of the day I would need to be able to find at least three things that went well during the day meant that I needed to make at least three good things happen, regardless of how I was feeling. This one change in our night has shown me the power of having people around me to hold me accountable to being grateful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not only influenced by this book I am looking to start/join a mastermind after reading the chapter on building a winning team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to summarize the book, but I’m definitely thankful for the knowledge that I’ve gained from it.&lt;/p&gt;
